# PHL Morse
# What is PHL?
PHL stands for Passive Haptic Learning. It is the acquisition of sensorimotor skills without active attention to learning. Vibrations are used to passively 'teach' the motor skill and are typically delivered by a wearable, tactile interface.
This is a concept researched by Georgia Tech PhD student, Caitlyn Seim, someone I had the pleasure of working under for the past year.

# So what is PHL Morse?
PHL Morse is an Android app that uses Passive Haptic Learning to teach you the Morse Code of every letter of the alphabet.
This app was developed by myself, and its UI was designed by my fellow student, Zaeem Adamjee, under the research and guidance of Caitlyn Seim.
It will soon be launched by Caitlyn and Professor Thad Starner on the Android Play Store.

# How is it used?
With an Android phone and Android Smartwatch. 
Connect your phone to your watch. Download the app (link will be uploaded here upon launch). Register, and follow the instructions!
You will need to listen (using headphones if you are outdoors, or without if you are on your own) to each letter as it is spoken out loud, after which your watch will vibrate its Morse Code.
The learning happens in words; each word is vibrated 20 times, but you may move on earlier if you feel you are ready to do so. Each lesson ends with a quiz to test your learning rate.
Soon you'll notice that Passive Learning really works!
You may also choose to relearn a certain word, or check your overall learning rate by taking a quiz of all letters learned so far.
